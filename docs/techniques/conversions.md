## Baking Ingredients: Volume to Weight

In baking, it's important to measure your ingredients accurately.
Baking is sensitive to variation because it involves chemical reactions such as leavening.
I like to use a kitchen scale to measure by weight: it's more consistent than measuring by volume with measuring cups.

| Ingredient | Volume | Weight |
|------------|--------|--------|
| All-purpose flour | 1 cup | 125 g |
| All-purpose flour (sifted) | 1 cup | 118 g |
| Bread flour | 1 cup | 130 g |
| Cake flour | 1 cup | 118 g |
| Cake flour (sifted) | 1 cup | 105 g |
| Brown sugar (packed) | 1 cup | 200 g |
| Butter | 1/2 cup (1 stick) | 115 g |
| Chocolate chips | 1 cup | 180 g |
| Cocoa powder | 1/2 cup | 41 g |
