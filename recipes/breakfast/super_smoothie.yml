  The best damn smoothie for balancing muscle-building, nutrition, convenience, and taste.
  I drink it every morning as two meals.
  
  This recipe leans on whey to boost its protein content.
  For a silky-smooth texture, we blend the greens and fruit in two stages.

  Feel free to experiment with different fruits and vegetables: I use 1 cup each of berries, baby spinach, and kale.
