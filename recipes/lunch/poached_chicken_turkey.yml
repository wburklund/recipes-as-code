  Poaching is an underrated method of cooking.
  It cooks food to a consistent temperature with no risk of burning.
  We also get to infuse the meat with the flavors of ingredients and herbs we add to the water.

  The resulting meat is super-soft and can be shredded with the paddle attachment of a stand mixer.
  I like to eat it in a bowl with [quinoa](/sides/#quinoa) and vegetables.
