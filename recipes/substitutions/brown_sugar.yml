  I hate having three different "colors" of sugar to manage.
  This substitution replaces light brown sugar and dark brown sugar with appropriate ratios of white sugar and molasses.
  After all, brown sugar - molasses = white sugar!

  Use 1 tbsp molasses for light brown sugar, 2 tbsp molasses for dark brown sugar.
  You could also use this recipe with other sweeteners to get brown sugar taste with greatly reduced calories.
ingredients:
  - name: White sugar
    amount: 1 cup
  - name: Molasses
    amount: 1 tbsp or 2 tbsp
produces: One cup light brown sugar or dark brown sugar equivalent.
