name: Butter
description: |
  Did you know butter is 50% saturated fat?
  This recipe replaces the saturated fat in batter with unsaturated fat from canola oil.
  It acts and tastes like butter in most recipes.

  Note that some recipes, biscuits especially, call for chunks of butter.
  In the oven, the chunks melt, evaporate, and leave behind pockets of air that create a flaky texture.
  I'm not sure how to reproduce that with a liquid.
