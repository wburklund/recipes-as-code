name: Butter
description: |
  Did you know butter is 50% saturated fat?
  This recipe replaces the saturated fat in batter with unsaturated fat from canola oil.
  It acts and tastes like butter in most recipes.

  Note that butter acts as a leavening agent in baking.
  If someone figured out how to replicate that effect, you could make flaky biscuits and muffins using oil.
